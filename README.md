# Terraform 

## Configure Terraform as Infrastructure as a code (IaC)

As a DevOps enthusiast, I want to use Terraform to define and manage AWS resources.
. Terraform is installed on the local machine or CI runner.
. Terraform configurations for AWS resources are written in the infra directory.
. A remote backend for Terraform state is configured.
. A GitLab CI pipeline for Terraform is created and tested.

## Getting Started

1.**Clone the Repository**:

Begin by cloning the terraform as IaC to your local machine.
git clone <https://gitlab.com/infra8700923/terraform>

## Key Highlights

1) Directory Structure: Organized Terraform files in a dedicated infra directory for better maintainability and clarity.
2) Automation: Leveraged GitLab CI to automate the Terraform workflow, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual interventions.
3) Collaboration: Hosted our repository on both GitLab and GitHub to foster greater collaboration and accessibility within our team and the wider DevOps community.
